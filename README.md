- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Data and Inference Pipelines for Explainable Artificial Intelligence**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Network administration and Cybersecurity**
- 💬 Ask me about **Explainable AI** or **[listen to me talk about it](https://www.empaia.org/academy-2-3)**

> Work demonstrated here includes [segmenting glomeruli in kidney tissue](https://github.com/theodore-evans/glomeruli-segmentation), [developing agent-based models of game learning](https://github.com/theodore-evans/k-level-reasoning), [creating a framework for feedforward neural networks](https://github.com/theodore-evans/feedforward-neural-network), and [deploying a survey for a journal paper on explainable AI in digital pathology](https://github.com/theodore-evans/xai-in-digital-pathology).
